    "The primary objectives of this RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solution are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Enable Querying and Information Retrieval:** The main goal is to build a system capable of answering user queries by retrieving relevant information directly from a corpus of insurance policy PDF documents.\n",
    "2.  **Provide Accurate and Contextualized Answers:** The solution aims to deliver precise and contextually appropriate answers to specific questions posed by users, leveraging the content within the insurance policies.\n",
    "3.  **Enhance Information Access:** A key objective is to significantly improve the ease of access and retrieval of critical information from complex and often lengthy insurance policy documents, making it more efficient for users to find what they need.\n",
    "4.  **Ensure Transparency and Trustworthiness through Citation:** The solution intends to provide citations, including the exact source (policy name and page number) of the retrieved information, thereby ensuring transparency, verifiability, and trustworthiness of the generated answers."

    "The primary data source for this project is the `Principal-Sample-Life-Insurance-Policy.pdf` file. This PDF document contains the content of a sample life insurance policy, which is crucial for building a RAG system to answer insurance-related queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process this PDF, the `pdfplumber` library was utilized. Its role was fundamental in opening the PDF document, iterating through each page, and meticulously extracting both regular text and tabular data. The library allows for detailed access to the layout of each page, including word coordinates and table bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom function, `check_bboxes`, was implemented to assist in the table extraction process. This function's purpose was to distinguish between words that are part of a table and those that are regular text. By comparing the bounding box of each word with the bounding boxes of identified tables, it ensured accurate segregation of content types.\n",
    "\n",
    "After identifying both non-table words and extracted tables, `pdfplumber.utils.cluster_objects` was employed. This utility is critical for maintaining the chronological order of text and tables as they appear in the original PDF, ensuring that the extracted content preserves its natural reading flow. It groups related elements together based on their vertical position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the extracted and ordered data was structured into a Pandas DataFrame named `insurance_pdfs_data`. This DataFrame includes columns for 'Page No.', 'Page_Text' (containing the aggregated text and table content for each page), and 'Document Name', providing a clean and organized dataset for further processing."

    "To optimize performance and reduce API calls, a caching mechanism was implemented using a separate ChromaDB collection named `Insurance_Cache`. This cache stores previous queries and their corresponding retrieval results. Before performing a full semantic search on the `insurance_collection`, the system first queries the `cache_collection` with the user's input (`cache_results = cache_collection.query(query_texts=query, n_results=1)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `threshold` (set to `0.2`) determines whether a cached result is sufficiently similar to the current query. If `cache_results['distances'][0]` is empty (no cache hit) or the `distance` of the closest cached entry is *greater* than the `threshold`, it indicates that the current query is not closely matched by any cached query. In this scenario, a new semantic search is performed on the `insurance_collection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, if a new search is performed, the query and its top 10 retrieval results (including IDs, documents, distances, and metadatas) are then added to the `cache_collection`. The query itself is stored as the document, and the retrieved information is stored as metadata for that cache entry. This pre-populates the cache for future, similar queries. If, however, the `distance` of a cached result is *less than or equal to* the `threshold`, it signifies a good match, and the cached results (documents, metadatas, etc.) are directly retrieved and used, avoiding a redundant search on the main collection."

    "After the initial semantic search retrieves a set of potentially relevant documents from the `insurance_collection`, a reranking step is applied to further refine the results and improve their relevance to the user's query. This is achieved using a **CrossEncoder model**, specifically `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`. \n",

    "The `CrossEncoder` takes a pair of inputs (the user query and each retrieved document) and outputs a single score indicating the semantic similarity or relevance between them. Unlike semantic search, which embeds query and document independently, a cross-encoder jointly embeds them, often leading to more precise relevance scores. The `cross_encoder.predict()` method is used to generate these `cross_rerank_scores` for the top `n_results` (e.g., 10) documents obtained from the semantic search. These scores are then used to sort the documents, presenting the most relevant ones to the LLM for RAG."

    "5.  **Table Handling:** If the document text contains relevant tables (represented as a list of lists), the LLM should reformat and present this information in a tabular format within its answer.\n",
    "6.  **Partial Answers:** If a complete answer cannot be provided, the LLM should offer guidance on how the user can find more information in the cited documents.\n",

    "8.  **Irrelevant Queries:** If the query is deemed irrelevant to the provided documents, the LLM should state so.\n",

    "Developing this RAG solution involved several key challenges and considerations across different stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Accurate PDF Content Extraction:**\n",
    "    *   **Complex Layouts:** PDFs often have varied and complex layouts, including multi-column text, images, and non-standard tables. `pdfplumber`, while powerful, can struggle with maintaining the correct reading order or accurately extracting text from highly stylized documents, leading to fragmented or jumbled content.\n",
    "    *   **Non-Standard Fonts and Encoding:** Documents using custom fonts or unusual text encodings can result in character misinterpretations or missing text during extraction.\n",
    "    *   **Embedded Objects:** Information embedded within images or non-textual objects (like scanned documents) is difficult to extract programmatically, potentially leading to loss of crucial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Determining Effective Caching Strategies:**\n",
    "    *   **Similarity Threshold (`threshold`):** Choosing an optimal similarity threshold for the cache is critical. A high threshold might lead to too many cache misses, while a low threshold could result in irrelevant cached responses being returned. This requires careful empirical tuning to balance relevance and cache hit rate.\n",
    "    *   **Information to Store:** Deciding what information to store in the `cache_collection` (e.g., just the query and response, or also the retrieved documents, metadatas, and distances) impacts storage requirements and retrieval complexity. Storing more metadata enhances debugging and re-ranking capabilities but increases storage and potential cache invalidation overhead.\n",
    "    *   **Performance vs. Storage/Invalidation:** A robust caching strategy must balance the performance gains from faster responses against the storage costs and the complexity of cache invalidation (e.g., if underlying documents change).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Fine-tuning the RAG Prompt for Optimal Results:**\n",
    "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting an effective prompt for the Large Language Model (LLM) is an iterative process. It involves clearly instructing the LLM on its role, the context provided (query and retrieved documents), expected output format, and constraints (e.g., citing sources). Over-constraining or under-constraining the prompt can lead to poor quality or irrelevant answers.\n",
    "    *   **Accurate Citation Generation:** Ensuring the LLM accurately cites the provided source documents (policy name and page number) can be challenging. The LLM might hallucinate citations or miss relevant ones if the prompt isn't precise enough or if the retrieved context is dense.\n",
    "    *   **Handling Insufficient/Ambiguous Information:** When retrieved documents don't contain a direct answer or provide ambiguous information, the LLM might struggle to provide a concise and accurate response. Fine-tuning the prompt to gracefully handle these scenarios (e.g., by stating it cannot find the information or suggesting further areas to search) is crucial for user experience."

    "This project successfully developed and demonstrated a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution designed to enable effective querying and information retrieval from complex insurance policy PDF documents. The primary achievement lies in transforming unstructured PDF content into a searchable knowledge base, allowing users to ask natural language questions and receive precise, relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall effectiveness of the RAG solution is evident in its ability to provide highly contextualized answers. By combining semantic search with a reranking mechanism and a large language model, the system can understand the intent behind a user's query and retrieve the most pertinent sections from the insurance policies. A key strength of this implementation is the inclusion of verifiable citations, automatically referencing the policy name and specific page number from which the information was extracted. This feature significantly enhances the trustworthiness and utility of the generated responses, allowing users to cross-reference information directly within the source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a system holds substantial value and potential impact, especially in domains like insurance where documents are often lengthy, complex, and critical for decision-making. It drastically reduces the time and effort required to locate specific information, improves accuracy in understanding policy details, and empowers both customers and internal stakeholders with quick, reliable access to policy knowledge. This RAG solution serves as a robust tool for navigating and extracting insights from intricate documentation."
